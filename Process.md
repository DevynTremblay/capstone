Engineering Process Plan
========================

Our engineering process will be prototyping, fast, and iterative.

Our goal will be to create an initial design that should work and then gradually refine it.
This is easier than trying to get everything right at once.


Devyns main idea
take a basic bike BMX Mountain or even Racing
strap a basic motor from say a chainsaw, weed wacker, or even lawn mower (prefeably on the back wheel using the pre-existing gear)
of course there is going to need to be a counter weight on the oppostie side i was thinking just strapping some basic weights and extending the wheel axel out to accomodate both.
also if at all possible a set of hand made training wheels would be very nice in order to keep the alignment in check and also a safety feature.
this safety feature will stop the bike from falling over
to power the motor we need a basic black and decker recharable battery and a trigger (saftey taken off) attached to the handle bar almost like a dirt bike
