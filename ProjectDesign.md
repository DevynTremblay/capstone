Design Document
===============

Below are a number of design proposals.

Devyn's Proposal
----------------

1. Take a basic BMX, mountain, or even racing bike.

2. Strap a basic motor from a chainsaw, weed wacker, or even lawnmower
   (preferably on the back wheel using the pre-existing gear).

3. Add a counterweight to the opposite side.

4. Add a set of handmade training wheels to stop the bike from falling over.

5. Add a basic Black & Decker rechargeable battery somewhere and a trigger (with
   the safety removed) to the handle bar, almost like a dirt bike.

Hector's Proposal
-----------------

Add to any existing design an auto-balancing mechanism such as found in a
Segway, except with the balance axis perpendicular to the axis of travel. This
replaces training wheels and allows the bike to remain vertical even while
stationary.

i see one issue with this, it may alter the bikes total mobility and therefore prevent the speed in turning that we may need to use
if anything we need a light wieght mid-bike ball that hangs off allowing the bike a proper stability while riding
